<p>This map is generated from a Jupyter Notebook file in <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/talkmap.ipynb">talkmap.ipynb</a>, which mines the location fields in my talk pages.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I have NO control over the borders, territory, and names presented on the generated map. </p>
