Welcome to my personal academic page! In academia, the information is quite scattered across various academic websites, which all have their specialized focuses with limited flexibility. A personal academic information hub website allows me to freely communicate science as I wish.

Biography
==============================

Jiaye is currently a PhD researcher and doctoral assistant at Photonic Systems Laboratory (PHOSL), Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering (IEM), School of Engineering (STI), [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). His expertise and current research interests span ultrafast light-matter-interactions, nonlinear optics and nanophotonics in epsilon-near-zero materials, fibre, fibre laser, and waveguide network design, functional thin film design, and non-Hermitian optics. He received M.Sc. degree in Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics (Integrated Photonic Devices) from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021 with the highest honours, and B.Sc. degree in Optical Information Science and Technology (Xiangqin Optoelectronic Creative Class) from [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/) in 2018 with distinction. Throughout his academic trajectory, he has consistently exemplified a commitment to outstanding scholarship. His prolific publications include 20+ academic papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D2n8tswAAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fjiaye-wu%2Fjiaye-wu.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> (incl. 16+ as first author and 3 as corresponding author) in peer-reviewed esteemed journals such as *Nature Communications*, *Laser & Photonics Reviews*, *Communications Physics*, *Photonics Research*, *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*, etc. He served as a peer-reviewer for *Communications Physics*, *Optics Express*, *Optics Letters*, *Optics & Laser Technology*, etc., and a co-reviewer for *Nature*, *Light: Science & Applications*, etc. He is an active member of Elsevier Advisory Panel, OPTICA (formerly OSA, the Optical Society) and IEEE Photonics Society. He was the founding president of IEEE Photonics Society PKUSZ branch chapter and the president of OSA PKUSZ chapter.
