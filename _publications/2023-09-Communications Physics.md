Temporal Talbot effect, the intriguing phenomenon of the self-imaging of optical pulse trains, is extensively investigated using macroscopic components. However, the ability to manipulate pulse trains, either bright or dark, through the Talbot effect on integrated photonic chips to replace bulky instruments has rarely been reported. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-principle integrated silicon nitride device capable of imprinting the Talbot phase relation onto in-phase optical combs and generating the two-fold self-images at the output. We show that the GHz-repetition-rate bright and dark pulse trains can be doubled without affecting their spectra as a key feature of the temporal Talbot effect. The designed chip can be electrically tuned to switch between pass-through and repetition-rate-multiplication outputs and is compatible with other related frequencies. The results of this work lay the foundations for the large-scale system-on-chip photonic integration of Talbot-based pulse multipliers, enabling the on-chip flexible up-scaling of pulse trainsâ€™ repetition rate without altering their amplitude spectra.
