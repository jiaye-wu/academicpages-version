An enhanced open source MATLAB project for general-purpose symmetrized split-step software.

SSPROP-NFOL
======

[SSPROP-NFOL](https://github.com/jiaye-wu/SSPROP-NFOL) is the enhanced Windows AMD64/X64 (compiled) distribution of SSPROP, maintained and personally used by the author. 

SSPROP-NFOL is also a general-purpose symmetrized split-step software routine that can be invoked directly from Matlab to solve the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation. It guarantees the same efficiency as SSPROP originally by Photonics Research Laboratory, Maryland University (https://www.photonics.umd.edu/software/ssprop/). 

SSPROP-NFOL is a **ready-to-use SSPROP distribution** compiled for **Windows 10 64-Bit PCs/Tablets** and **newer MATLAB 64-Bit versions above 7.5** (test environment MATLAB 64-Bit 9.1.0.441655 R2016b, Windows 10 Spring Creator Update 1803) **along with many exclusive new features and useful functions**. It is ready to use right out-of-the-box. It provides propagation algorithm command using *MATLAB MEXW64* and supports *intrapulse Raman scattering* & *self-steepening effect*. Other improvements can be found in Changelog.txt.

SSPROP-NFOL is an open-source software under GPL v3.

SSPROP-NFOL-DemoCode
======

[SSPROP-NFOL-DemoCode](https://github.com/jiaye-wu/SSPROP-NFOL-DemoCode) repository shows how to utilize SSPROP-NFOL project. The demo codes reproduce many of the numerical results that are presented in Chapter 3 to Chapter 5 in Govind. P. Agrawal's book, "Nonlinear Fiber Optics", 5th Edition.
