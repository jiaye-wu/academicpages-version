Following the publishing of our recent work at *Nature Communications* entitled [Thermo-optic epsilon-near-zero effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45054-z), Springer-Nature invited us to write a behind-the-paper blog post: [Towards photonic on-chip integration: Strong linear and nonlinear thermo-optic effects enhanced by near-zero permittivity on a nanolayer](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/towards-photonic-on-chip-integration-strong-linear-and-nonlinear-thermo-optic-effects-enhanced-by-near-zero-permittivity-on-a-nanolayer).
